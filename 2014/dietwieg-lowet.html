<p>In the western world, there is an increasing number of elderly people, while the number of younger people remains constant or even declines. This puts a huge stress on the elderly care system.</p> 
<p>In the Florence project we have investigated how robot technology can support elderly people to live longer independently in their own home. We have developed a multipurpose robot platform offering three building blocks for elderly care services: (1) robotic telepresence, (2) unobtrusive monitoring and (3) cognitive assistance.</p> 
<p>In this talk, I will provide an overview of the key lessons learned and future opportunities.</p>
