<p>Right now, humanity still as the role of controller with the law based on that assumption. But when software takes over tasks from humans, a self-driving car will need to get a drivers license.
We should there for aim to gain insight into how predictable (self-learning) software is and to what extend it can exhibit safe driving behaviour on the road.</p>
<p>And, if there happens to be an accident, can we then assertain how the software made its decisions to for example break, evade or accelerate? With tradition 'if-then' software, this is doable. For AI however, the story is not so simple.</p>
<p>This is something that we, at RDW, do not have a clear vision on and this brings me to a related question I would like to ask the general public: Is AI capable of saving lives in traffic?</p>
