<p>Right now, all legislation is based on the fact that a driver in a vehicle is a human.</p>
<p>But when software takes over all driving tasks from humans, a self-driving car will need to get a drivers license.</p>
<p>We should therefore aim to gain insight into how (self-learning) software can exhibit safe and predictable driving behavior on the public roads.</p>
<p>And if an accident occurs, can we then track back how the software made its decisions to - for example - break, evade or accelerate?</p>
<p>With traditional 'if-then' software, this is doable. For AI however, this is the question.</p>
<p>This is something that we, at RDW, do not have a clear vision on.</p>
<p>And this brings a related question for the audience: is AI capable of saving lives in traffic?"</p>
