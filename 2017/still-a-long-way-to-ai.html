<p>AI is hot right now: algorithms are closing the gap between human performance in tasks that have resisted many previous efforts, ranging from games like poker and Go to abilities like object recognition, speech recognition, and language translation. In particular, deep neural networks have been stealing the show recently, and their loose analogy to the brain breeds rampant speculation that human-level AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is near. In this talk I will discuss both the hype—some of which could be deserved—and the reality, and how it falls short of the near-futures seen in Hollywood movies (e.g., “Her”). Included will be an overview of the algorithms and data used in your favorite chatbots and personal digital assistants, and how they differ in scale and type from human language mechanisms. Ultimately, I will make the case that a better understanding of human cognition—the best example of intelligence we know of—will be needed in order to make general artificial intelligence.</p>
