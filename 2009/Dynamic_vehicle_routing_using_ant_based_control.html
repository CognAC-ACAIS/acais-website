subject: Dynamic vehicle routing using Ant Based Control

<p>Since 1995 there is a project called “SmartRoad” running at TUDelft. The goal of the project was to design ICT solutions for for traffic control and warning systems. In this paper we focus on dynamic routing systems.

The basic idea is that car drivers communicate with each other via an intelligent system implemented on the network of lamppost. By tracking individual car drivers the system gets real time information of traffic speed along the roads. Based on that information dynamic routing algorithm has been designed, which is based on concepts of artificial life.

The Ant Based Control (ABC-) routing algorithm computes the shortest traveling time from start to destination. A simulation environment has been implemented and experimental results of static and dynamic routing will be presented.</p>
