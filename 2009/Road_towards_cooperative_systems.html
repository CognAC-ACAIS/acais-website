<p>Advanced Driver Assistance systems (ADAs) such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) as well as navigation systems are available on many car models and becoming increasingly popular nowadays. Dynamic traffic management and traffic information have undergone a strong development over the past years and are being deployed network-wide. In the past developments in both fields of expertise took place separately, either infrastructure related or related to the vehicle itself. Due to the maturation of communication technologies both worlds have become connected into cooperative systems. More complex, but also with a lot of potential.

In this presentation the state of the art of ADAs and cooperative systems will be shown as well as current projects and initiatives in the field of intelligent vehicles and intelligent infrastructure.</p>
