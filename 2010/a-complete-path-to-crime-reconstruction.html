subject: A Complete Path to Crime Reconstruction
---
<p>Over the last couple of years more and more cameras are placed in public spaces. The resulting videos are not only used to instantaneously react to crimes, but also to find out what exactly happened during a reported crime. For this, a complete reconstruction of the crime needs to be created. Unfortunetly, this is a very time-consuming process as all videos have to be analysed from beginning to end all persons involved are to be tracked.</p>

<p>To aid in this process the University of Amsterdam in association with the Dutch Forensic Institute develops computer programme that (1) automatically detects persons, (2) follows those persons, and (3) gives a complete overview of all events. In this talk I will discuss all elements of this programme and give a demonstration of the complete system.</p>
