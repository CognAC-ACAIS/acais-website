<p>The RoboCup@Home league aims to develop service and assistive robot technology with high relevance for future personal domestic applications. It is the largest international annual competition for social autonomous service robots and is part of the RoboCup initiative. A set of benchmark tests is used to evaluate the robots' abilities and performance in a realistic non-standardized home environment setting. </p>
<p>In this talk the founder of RoboCup@Home will explain, and show, how this initiative is helping R&amp;D teams with the creation of social robots. He will discuss the history of RoboCup in general and how this lead to the @Home benchmark.</p>
<p>There are many different tests in RoboCup@Home. Perhaps the most disruptive is that in 2010 the first test benchmarking robot cognition was introduced. This is leading to robots being aware of their physical and social environment, although still on a rudimentary level.</p>
<p>At the moment more than 100 research groups around the planet use RoboCup@Home as a part of their research efforts which generated more than a 1000 articles in the last decade.</p>
