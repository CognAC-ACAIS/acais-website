<p>Is it good to have positive expectations about a social event, such as ACAIS 2018? Or can it save us a lot of disappointment if we expected the worst? This is but one question that can be answered with the help of text mining. In this talk I will advocate the utility of text mining, and introduce some far from solved tasks. After hearing the talk you might end up motivated to help the text mining field further.<br>
<br>...or just experience #anticipointment. </p>
