<p>The influence of human enhancement on ourselves and our society. Human enhancement, or the use of biomedical technologies like medicine or medical procedures by healthy users to improve themselves, offers attractive possibilities in the eyes of some scholars. Other scholars, on the other hand, vehemently reject improving healthy human beings with biomedical technologies. But what are the technologies that evoke these radically different reactions? And how can society deal with the (expected) rise of these technologies? To explore these questions, I will first discuss some human enhancement technologies and will explore how the general public views human enhancement technologies. Based on this, I will then discuss some recommendations for the governance of human enhancement and the urgency of thinking and talking about technologies that have the ability to radically alter ourselves.
